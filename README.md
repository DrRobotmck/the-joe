>In NYC a decent cup of coffee isn't hard to find, a great cup is. That's where **The Joe** comes in.
   - *Everyone ever*

**Joe** takes the guesswork out of finding the best coffee this city has to offer. Whether it's nestled in a old Italian cafe on the edge of Bushwick, or in the heart of SoHo, **Joe's** got you covered. **Joe** maps out all the best spots across the boros and will help you find that sweet elixir no matter where you are. 
Not quite sure what that drink is on the menu you've thought about trying a million times? **Joe's** got a list of all the coffee terminology you need to know to order like a pro. What's a Cortado? **Joe** knows.

Starbucks is a dime a dozen, dotting corners as far as the eye can see. A dollar can get you a steaming hot cup of coffee at almost any street cart or bodega. But why settle when you can have the best? There's great coffee everywhere in this city. Let **Joe** help you find it.
